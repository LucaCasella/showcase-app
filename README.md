# Matteo Mambelli: Wedding and Event Photographer

This is the project repository for `Matteo Mambelli: Wedding and Event Photographer`.

## Initial Setup

For the first-time setup, you will need to install the necessary dependencies. Run the following commands:
```bash
composer install
```

```bash
npm install
```
## App initialization
"After cloning the repository from GitHub, run the command App::init. This command will generate a new .env file, copy the contents from the .env.example file, and generate the keys for Laravel. Some variables, such as DB_PASSWORD, DB_NAME, etc., in the .env file need to be modified according to your system configuration."
```bash
php artisan App:init
```

## Database Migration

After setting up your environment file and generating an application key, you need to run the database migrations. Laravelâ€™s migration system allows you to build your database schema in a structured way. To migrate your database, navigate to your project's root directory and run the following command:
```bash
php artisan artisan migrate
```

After the installation is complete, you can start the project by running:
