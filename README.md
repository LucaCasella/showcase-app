# Matteo Mambelli: Wedding and Event Photographer

This is the project repository for `Matteo Mambelli: Wedding and Event Photographer`.

## Initial Setup

For the first-time setup, you will need to install the necessary dependencies. Run the following commands:
```bash
  composer install
```

```bash
  npm install
```
## Environment File Setup
After cloning the repository, you must configure the environment variables to suit your system. To simplify this process, use the `App:init` command.
```bash
  php artisan App:init
```


## Database Migration

After setting up your environment file and generating an application key, you need to run the database migrations. Laravelâ€™s migration system allows you to build your database schema in a structured way. To migrate your database, navigate to your project's root directory and run the following command:
```bash
  php artisan migrate
```

After the installation is complete, you can start the project by running:
```bash
  php artisan start:project
```
# Test application in an environment that simulate production 

Once you've finished building your new features and want to see how they'll work in a real-world setting, you can spin up a Docker container to mimic your production environment. Here's how:

This command build vite and its manifest json

step 1 run command:
```bash
  npm run build
```

This command allow you to set up properly docker variable 

step 2 run command:
```bash
  php artisan Docker:set
```
This command build a docker container that simulate production environment, before verify that your docker app desktop is running

step 3 run command:
```bash
  docker-compose up -d
```

After the container starts, go to the Docker's address in your browser. Once the first page loads, navigate to the "/migrations" route. This will initialize the database with some data. You can also log in.
